# Mothership Reports

The `Message\Mothership\Report` cogule provides a framework for providing reports and statistics in a new tab in the control panel.

At v1.0.0, this is essentially just the reports that were custom-built for Uniform Wares. The plan is so abstract this over time and redesign/rebuild the reports system to work how **we** want it to work.
